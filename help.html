        <h4 class="inter-medium">What is Join?</h4>
        <p class="inter-extralight">
          <span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
          students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        </p>

        <p class="inter-extralight">
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
          work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to
          help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
        </p>

        <p class="inter-extralight">
          It is important to note that <span>Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
          extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
          consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
